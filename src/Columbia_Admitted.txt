Statement of Purpose
Aren t people afraid the social credit system might infringe people’s privacy with everything on record despite its convenience of transactions?” Bill Foster the Congressman asked me when I interned at the US Congress This question reminded me of the calls I received from constituents in Illinois who supported net neutrality and insisted that filtering content is a violation to the First Amendment These drew my attention to people’s basic rights—whether privacy or freedom of speech is compromised as technology develops Hence I pondered “how can public policies be effectively implemented to protect human’s privacy and freedom of speech at this digital age and the coming of the AI era? How can public policies serve the interest of human beings in enhancing cybersecurity and economic development?”
To delve further I interned at the European Chamber of Commerce in China and joined the Cybersecurity and Information & Communication Technology working groups My responsibilities included following up and updating the team with news on policies of technology One day a news title grabbed my attention—General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) As I read I was excited to find that the European Union (EU) had taken action to combat privacy infringement by promulgating GDPR in May 2018 This has a worldwide impact regulating all online business activities to comply with GDPR as long as they access data of EU citizens I was fascinated by such mechanism ie the power of public policy that the EU enforced to protect the rights of digital citizens As a result I examined the implementation of technology policy in China During my internship at the Chamber I drafted consulting briefing notes for policy consultants on data policies in China and joined policy-consulting meetings with stakeholders I learned that Measures for Security Assessment of Cross-border and Transfer of Personal Information and Important Data regulate cross-border data transmission and compel all enterprises in China to abide by the law This is to prevent individual data of Chinese citizens from being disclosed to other countries However due to restriction on data transmission multinational companies faced difficulty in synchronizing their data with the headquarter outside of China They then sought our legal advice at the Chamber As an intern I collected and compiled those companies’ feedback on government’s measure and wrote reports for the Cyberspace Administration of China as a reference to amend the policy The hope was that the government would strike a balance between the interests of business and individual rights on privacy of personal information From this I observed how technology policy could potentially work in the real world
With the attained practical skills during my internship at the US Congress I was a step closer in pursuing this great cause and in becoming a policy maker When I worked for the Congressman I learned and practiced the process of formulating technology policy I attended hearings drafted memos for legislative staff and collected feedback from constituents on technology and other pertaining topics I also performed background research and conducted case analyses to write analytical reports on US Inter-state Agriculture Commerce and US Online Document Research System to help legislative staff draft related bills It was indeed fulfilling to help with the initial phase of forming public policies These experiences made me decide to dedicate my life to the public sector in technology policy I wanted to ensure that technology policy is effective in increasing social prosperity
Ten years on I see myself with sufficient public policy experience to tackle these issues I plan to work in a technology policy consulting firm in the first five years after I graduate from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in order to accumulate practical experience in the field Later I aim to return to China to work for the public sector in technology policy making This passion has taken me to where I am today I took a few relevant courses such as macroeconomics microeconomics and quantitative methodology on Coursera as a preparation for my study in public policy As a translation major my bilingual language skills in English and Chinese along with my previous research and analytical skills gave me an added advantage My interests in politics and international affairs have equipped me with insights into historical events which could serve as background knowledge in public policy analysis Moreover my diverse education background in UK and China shaped me to be an individual with awareness and understanding of cultural differences which will enable me to work well with people and give me first-hand knowledge to compare public policy across different countries
To achieve my career goals I need a systematic training in public policy at the graduate level Therefore I decided to apply to the Public Policy & Management (MSPPM) program at Heinz College CMU With advanced courses in R and data science such as Statistical Reasoning with R and Exploring and Visualizing Data Heinz College could strengthen my skills in data analytics which will prepare me to use data in problem solving The elective courses in statistics could provide knowledge of scientific approaches to design and administer public survey a pivotal skill in conducting research in public policy My management skills will be enhanced through courses such as Evidence-Based Management The attained knowledge in political science economics finance and latest technologies from CMU will be beneficial to my policy-making decisions in the future I am also looking forward to connecting with the highly innovative and distinguished alumni and professors at CMU I believe this experience will be invaluable and Heinz College will prepare me for my career goals and challenges of the new AI era
As my past experience in the field unfolds I realized effective public policy in technology has become important as it not only protects people’s basic rights but boosts social prosperity in the coming AI era With my background knowledge relevant internship experience and commitment in the field I am well prepared for a graduate study in the field and CMU is the best place to launch my career journey
