Prompt Why are you interested in pursuing your graduate business degree at this stage in your lifecareer  What are your shortterm and longterm career goals and how will this graduate business program help you achieve these goals
For a long time I have been inspired by a quote from my favorite movie Fight Club that The things you own end up owning you which has always motivated me to deeply think about who I am Growing up I found that I shared certain core values of the movie – an intrinsic refusal to be defined by the norms of others rather steadfast pursuit of finding my own meaning of life After a struggling process of selfawareness I finally found my meaning to celebrate the diverse beauty of life and to influence people in a positive way Thus I love reading books and appreciate artworks and I have traveled the world alone or with groups I am volunteering for experienced different cultures and encountered all walks of life because I believe that through doing so I would fulfill my life goals However one event has completely reshaped my perspective of looking at the world and consequently piqued my interest in pursuing graduate study in Business Analysis and Project Management

My cognitive change happened during my internship at Tantan  one of the biggest Chinese internet companies famous for its dating app As my internship went my habit of relying on traditional business practices to analyze problems had been reshaped by several examples showing advantages of Data Analytics One day we found out that the conversion rate of Indian female is much lower than that of the overall female The traditional solution would be to simply increase the budget to optimize advertisements on acquiring Indian female users However the datadriven thinking inspired me to drill down and keep asking myself relevant questions Which step is the culprit of the low conversion rate in acquisition channel the first step from Views to Installs or the second step from Installs to Conversions I extracted the background data to compare the corresponding metrics from a comparable country and found no significant difference That’s weird I murmured but I did not give up digging further Then I drilled down to different segments (Good Fake Inactive Pending etc) in the second step and had a milestone finding! There were about 16% of Indian female users labeled as Inactive a rate that was 10% higher than benchmarks To understand the drivers I worked with colleagues to conduct interviews uncovering that the cause is lowquality profiles of the male
At that time we decided to build a stricter moderation background to solve this problem Because India is a new market we weren’t familiar with the regulations for Indian market and all the existing users’ profiles were moderated by Chinese monitors Therefore we need to resolve two difficulties urgently how to adjust to strict regulations for Indian users and how to implement the various strategies step by step To solve the first problem I coordinated with my Indian teammates and colleagues of domestic moderation background We formulated new regulations for Indian users by analyzing the questionnaire survey from targeted Indian female and data report about domestic moderation background To solve the second problem we decided to employ local monitors and divide former moderation background into different channels by country Therefore together with my Indian teammates I immediately launched recruitment Ads and employed two temporary monitors Meanwhile I acted as a bridge between programmers and monitors to report bugs and ensure the Indian channel could operate well Fortunately all of our implementations operated effectively and we successfully solved this problem resulting in a conversion rate growth of 3%
Although sometimes I was called rebellious or free spirited by my parents and good friends my experience at Tantan and years of training in Engineering and Science have proven to me that statistics and data are new ways to comprehend and better reflect this world Thus I have been exploring better methods and tools in rational analysis to deepen my understanding of the world As a result I am eager to advance my skillsets through graduate study
When it comes to my career goals  in the short term after graduation I would like to work as a data analyst in a multinational company to help its international growth and improve user experience In the long run my aspiration is to create an international social media with mission to make the world better connected through working with people coming from diverse backgrounds I would like to lead the team and fulfill my life long goal to make positive contributions to the world with good purpose high integrity and differentiation in addressing problems using a datadriven thinking process and solutions
Following my intended path the curriculum offered by your program is exactly what I need Courses like Business Process Modeling & Data Management and Data Analytics using R would provide me with the necessary theories and tools to make factbased datadriven decisions and improve business operations The Project Leadership and Communications and Advanced Business Analytics & Project Management would enlighten me with necessary soft skills needed during project implementation Moreover the outstanding alumni network and the superior location of University of Connecticut which is about a few hours away of New York City would serve as an excellent stepping stone to achieve my career goal MSBAPM is aimed to provide businesses professionals who are eager to create immediate value and realize their goals with the knowledge and platform With project management integrated in the program I am convinced that the program would meet and exceed my expectations in terms of transitioning from a data analytics practitioner to a wellrounded future entrepreneur It is a crucial step for me since I am determined to launch my own company in the long run As an international student who is used to work with people of diverse background and thoroughly enjoyed it I believe I am a perfect fit of the School of Business of U Conn I could also share my things I learned from my internship and volunteer experience with the greater U Conn Community I would be honored to be part of the MSBAPM program and further my study in University of Connecticut
